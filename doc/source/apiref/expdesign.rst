Experiment Design Algorithms
============================

Introduction
------------

The information gathered by updates of a posterior distribution, such as the
updates generated by the SMC approximation, can be used to inform the choice
of future experiments. The :class:`ExperimentDesigner` encapsulates and
automates this process by designing experiments that minimize an objective
function

.. math::
    O(\vec{e}) = r(\vec{e}) + k C(\vec{e}),
    
where :math:`r(\vec{e})` is the Bayes risk (see [GFWC12]_), :math:`C(\vec{e})`
is a cost function describing the cost associated with each experiment and where
:math:`k` is a parameter describing how much we are willing to pay for
reductions in risk. In QInfer, the cost function is specified as a method of
the :class:`~qinfer.abstract_model.Simulatable` class under study.
