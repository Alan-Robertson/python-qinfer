class ScoreMixin(object):
    r"""
    A mixin which includes a method ``score`` that numerically estimates the
    score of the likelihood function. Any class which mixes in this class 
    should be equipped with a property ``n_modelparams`` and a method 
    ``likelihood`` to satisfy dependency.

        Returns the step size to be used in numerical differentiation with 
        respect to the model parameters.
        
        The step size is given as a vector with length ``n_modelparams`` so 
        that each model parameter can be weighted independently.

        Calls are represented as a four-index tensor
        ``score[idx_modelparam, idx_outcome, idx_model, idx_experiment]``.
        The left-most index may be suppressed for single-parameter models.
        
        The numerical gradient is computed using the central difference method, 
        with step size given by the property `~ScoreMixin.h`.
        
        If return_L is True, both `q` and the likelihood `L` are returned as `q, L`.
