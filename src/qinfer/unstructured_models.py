class UnstructuredFrequencyModel(Model):
	r"""
	Represents estimating a likelihood function of the form

	.. math::

		\Pr(0 | \vec{a}, \vec{\omega}, \vec{\phi}; t) = \sum_i a_i \cos^2(\omega_i t + \phi_i),

	where :math:`\vec{x} = (\vec{a}, \vec{\omega}, \vec{\phi})` are the
	model parameters.

	# TODO: INITIALIZER
	#       Needs to take number of peaks.

	# TODO: DEFINE PARAMETERS
	#       expparams is just a float, but modelparams is 3 * n_peaks
	#       define names, number

	# TODO: DEFINE VALIDITY

	# TODO: CANONICALIZE
	#       this will be a pain: sort by omega, keeping a and phi in same order,
	#       then normalize to sum_i a_i = 1. Is this valid?
