## FUNCTIONS ###################################################################

def weighted_pairwise_distances(X, w, metric='euclidean'):
    r"""
    Given a feature matrix ``X`` with weights ``w``, calculates the modified
    distance metric :math:`\tilde{d}(p, q) = d(p, q) / (w(p) w(q) N^2)`, where
    :math:`N` is the length of ``X``. This metric is such that "heavy" feature
    vectors are considered to be closer to each other than "light" feature
    vectors, and are hence correspondingly less likely to be considered part of
    the same cluster.
