class DirectViewParallelizedModel(Model):
    r"""
    Given an instance of a `Model`, parallelizes execution of that model's
    likelihood by breaking the ``modelparams`` array into segments and
    executing a segment on each member of a :ref:`~IPython.parallel.DirectView`.
    
    This :ref:`Model` assumes that it has ownership over the DirectView, such
    that no other processes will send tasks during the lifetime of the Model.
    
    TODO: describe parameters.
