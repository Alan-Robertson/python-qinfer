class DirectViewParallelizedModel(DerivedModel):
    r"""
    Given an instance of a :class:`Model`, parallelizes execution of that model's
    likelihood by breaking the ``modelparams`` array into segments and
    executing a segment on each member of a :class:`~ipyparallel.DirectView`.
    
    This :class:`Model` assumes that it has ownership over the DirectView, such
    that no other processes will send tasks during the lifetime of the Model.

    If you are having trouble pickling your model, consider switching to 
    ``dill`` by calling ``direct_view.use_dill()``. This mode gives more support 
    for closures.
    
    :param qinfer.Model serial_model: Model to be parallelized. This
        model will be distributed to the engines in the direct view, such that
        the model must support pickling.
    :param ipyparallel.DirectView direct_view: Direct view onto the engines
        that will be used to parallelize evaluation of the model's likelihood
        function.
    :param bool purge_client: If ``True``, then this model will purge results
        and metadata from the IPython client whenever the model cache is cleared.
        This is useful for solving memory leaks caused by very large numbers of
        calls to ``likelihood``. By default, this is disabled, since enabling
        this option can cause data loss if the client is being sent other tasks
        during the operation of this model.
    :param int serial_threshold: Sets the number of model vectors below which
        the serial model is to be preferred. By default, this is set to ``10 *
        n_engines``, where ``n_engines`` is the number of engines exposed by
        ``direct_view``.
